SE_APP is the client facing web application for the Vulcan Semester Project.\
\
The webpages are HTML/CSS on a Flask framework and a Python backend.\
\
App.py is the driver file.\
\
*The application is not complete as there is no connected database to hold login and registration information, as well as it lacks an API to connect with university databases.}
