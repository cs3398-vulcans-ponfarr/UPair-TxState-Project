SE_APP is the client facing web application for the Vulcan Semester Project.

The webpages are HTML/CSS on a Flask framework and a Python backend.

App.py is the driver file.\

*The application is not complete as there is no connected database to hold login and registration information, client preferences, as well as it lacks an API to connect with university databases.
