SE_APP is the client facing web application for the Vulcan Semester Project.

The webpages are HTML/CSS on a Flask framework and a Python backend.

App.py is the driver file.\

STATUS OF PROJECT.
*The application is not complete as there is no connected database to hold login and registration information, client preferences, as well as it lacks an API to connect with university databases. The front facing site needs to have added UX/UI features as well as added functionality.

NEXT STEP.
Next I'm going to focus on the UI/UX design and the compatability problem of putting together all of the aspects of the application i.e. Front end, back end, database, API. Of course if and when the application is ready for roll out, we will need to find a server to host. But first and for most I want to make the site useable and functionable. The means it works as intended.
