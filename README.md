[UPair] (working title)

Our Vision:

Our team of four will create an application targeted at the students of universities in an attempt to facilitate the creation of study groups. The application will help students who share similar schedules collaborate and study more efficiently.
  
Welcome to UPair!

UPair is an application that allows students to pair up with other students that share overlapping class schedules in order to facilitate grouping up to study. This should allow students to be more successful in their scholastic career. This application is unique in its ability to facilitate interconnectivity between students both on and off campus.

Help Support Development!

UPair can expand and spread to many different universities across the globe with help in the form of: server access at participating universities, a dedicated website, and an expanded development team to maintain and push out updates.

Current State of Program

UPair is currently non functional as the code is still be created by the development team. The development team is currently making progress toward runnable code. Current steps that are being taken are: the creation of program backbone, creation of database operation code, creation of program flow, and design of a graphical user interface. Current steps that have been completed: creation of a Use Case document for the program flow.
