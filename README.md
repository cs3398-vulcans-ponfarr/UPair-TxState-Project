# CS3398-Vulcan-S2019

[UPair] (working title)

Our Vision:

Our team of four will create an application targeted at the students of universities in an attempt to facilitate the creation of study groups. The application will help students who share similar schedules collaborate and study more efficiently.
  
Welcome to UPair!

UPair is an application that allows students to pair up with other students that share overlapping class schedules in order to facilitate grouping up to study. This should allow students to be more successful in their scholastic career. This application is unique in its ability to facilitate interconnectivity between students both on and off campus.

Help Support Development!

UPair can expand and spread to many different universities across the globe with help in the form of: server access at participating universities, a dedicated website, and an expanded development team to maintain and push out updates.

Current State of Program

UPair is currently non functional as the code is still be created by the development team. The development team is currently making progress toward runnable code. Current steps that are being taken are: the creation of program backbone, creation of database operation code, creation of program flow, and design of a graphical user interface. Current steps that have been completed: creation of a Use Case document for the program flow.

**REVIEW**
FEATURE AND ACCOMPLISHEMTS PER TEAM MEMBER:
-Example of artifact or code. reference to your personal readme. What your commits are. Status of the project and each of our next steps.

These files are notes used for creation of the Python backend. The code and notes are used to modify the operation of the program as it is developed. The User Class python file is to be used for the creation of different user objects. The Classes Class python file is to be used for the creation of different class objects. The Group Class python file is to be used for the creation of different group objects. All of these files will be modified as the program is developed to adapt to the needs of the program.

_WHAT'S NEXT_
Determine what needs to be built next in the back end. Build what is required for the back end. Work with Jacob and Peter to connect the back end with the database and website. Determine if there are any extras that can be built for the project.

•	Peter Cowsar, Artifacts: [Database](https://github.com/cs3398-vulcans-ponfarr/UPair-TxState-Project/blob/master/UPair.bak), [Database fill data](https://github.com/cs3398-vulcans-ponfarr/UPair-TxState-Project/blob/master/UPair_fill_data.sql), [Image displaying table structure](https://github.com/cs3398-vulcans-ponfarr/UPair-TxState-Project/blob/master/UPair_Table_Structure.png)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Database: This is a backup file for the database that can be used to recreate the database structure and contents. It is not possible to upload an immediately runnable database.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Database fill data: Some of the insert statements that were used to fill the table with mock data.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Table structure: Shows the structure of the tables in the database.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's next: Work with Jon and Jacob to connect the database to the python backend and website. Add more mock data. Possible modifications to database if necessary.

**RETROSPECTIVE**  
_WHAT WENT WELL AND WHAT DIDN'T_  
•	Everyone was willing to work and did what they could.  
•	Everyone understood and accepted their role.  
•	Everyone communicated when needed; everyone was responsive.  
•	The team could have benefited from meeting in person more often.    
•	The team struggled to produce initially due to a learning curve.  
•	Peter Cowsar:  
&nbsp;&nbsp; I got the database to a functional stage that could be used to test and create the application.  
&nbsp;&nbsp; I could have helped initiate the process of joining the database with the other application components.  

_WHAT MIGHT BE IMPEDING US FROM PERFORMING BETTER_  
•	The team's various schedules are not very compatible. Multiple meet ups are necessary to meet with every group member.

_WHAT CAN WE DO TO IMPROVE_  
•	The team can improve by meeting more often and developing a better understanding of the other members' work.  
•	Peter Cowsar: I could improve by scheduling times to meet with individual group members and scheduling my own working time. This would increase the quality and efficiency of my working hours significantly.
